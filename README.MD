# Apiarist

Those that have been active in the [Ethereum Swarm](https://swarm.ethereum.org)
for a while have come to know the desire to scale their hives 🐝, in effect
working to perfect the ancient art of bee keeping - to become *the* apiarist.

## Motivations

If you want your hives to *hummmm*, they need to be well planned. *Apiarist* is designed with the following intentions:

1. Number of 🐝 nodes: >1
2. Swap endpoint: Running our *own* geth goerli endpoint, independent of 
   slock.it and infura. We choose syncmode *light* here, but you could
   change it in the template.
3. Metrics: A template setup for *prometheus*, *grafana*, and *alertmanager*.
4. Clef: Scalable use of *clef* with one instance per hive.

## Dependencies

Use of this repository requires the following dependencies:

* Python
* virtualenv
* Build essentials
* npm / node (required for [monBee](https://github.com/ldeffenb/monBee)
  integration)
* docker
* docker-compose

## Configuration

All configuration is handled in `build.py` in easily digestible variable
names:

```python
# Every bee has it's day
versions = {
    'clef': '0.4.12',
    'bee': '0.6.2',
    'geth': 'v1.10.3'
}

# Where do we keep the sweet honey. This best be an SSD with enough storage
# space for all and plenty of IOPs.
paths = {
    'root': '/var/hive',
}

# The clef password - used to encrypt new ethereum accounts. Make this a 
# good password!
clef = {
    'password': 'passwordhere'
}

# Network port settings - let's make it easier to share pollen!
network = {
    'base_host_port': 1633,
    'base_external_port': 31000,
    'host_ip_addr': "192.168.1.100",         # Docker host's IP address.
    'external_ip_addr': "199.199.199.199",   # External IP address.
    'grafana_port': 3000,
    'geth_http_port': 8545,
    'geth_ws_port': 8546,
}
```

## Deploying

OK, you've donned your bee suit and ready to step out into the Swarm...

Bring the deployment up by:

```bash
$ sudo ./up.sh
```

This will bring the swarm up and print out the tearsheet, showing useful
information. An example follows:

```raw
$ sudo ./up.sh

Welcome to beeee keeping!

Your hive has been successfully deployed. The details are as follows:

Number of bees:         3
Grafana metrics:        http://192.168.1.100:3000
Grafana credentials:    admin/foobar
Goerli Endpoint (HTTP): http://192.168.1.100:8545
Goerli Endpoint (WS):   ws://192.168.1.100:8546


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NODE FUNDING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, you need to get your bee's funded, so head to #faucet on Ethereum Swarm's
discord server, and when you get there...

/faucet sprinkle 0xD3bd5bcEF1a41e7f89c31E22C00F7fB235dfbaa7
/faucet sprinkle 0x4E73B8fe0B2E9D1DCffDe684dd1C311281A9DD14
/faucet sprinkle 0x167c8779ADD5541663cA7D5F19230F28f9CC79f8


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECK YOUR NODE IS WORKING / GET LOGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You've funded your nodes, now you want to check if they're working OK. This 
means we need to dig into the logs! To do so, you can use these commands for
the respective nodes.

    docker logs bee-docker_bee-1_1
    docker logs bee-docker_bee-2_1
    docker logs bee-docker_bee-3_1

You can use the above command varied slightly to change the container name
to check on the status of other containers, like geth, etc.

How about checking for the metrics containers? This will show you all your
containers and how they're doing

    docker ps -a

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIREWALL / ROUTING RULES REQUIRED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awesome, you've made it this far. One of the problems plaguing the network at
the moment is "Peer not reachable when attempting to connect". Many, many,
people about this - the problem is that MOST nodes have failed to configure
inbound access, so when you try connect to them, YOU CAN'T! 

Now, as an enthusiastic apiarist, we know our honey tastes great, so we best
share it with the world! If you do NOT have a UPnP router, set the following
rules to ensure you can get inbound connections.

TCP: 199.199.199.199:31000 -> 192.168.1.100:1634
TCP: 199.199.199.199:31001 -> 192.168.1.100:1637
TCP: 199.199.199.199:31002 -> 192.168.1.100:1640

Once you've set these port forwarding firewall / routing rules, you can
monitor your bee's once again using the above docker logs commands and
monitor for inbound connections. If you've got them, congratulations, you're
making the Swarm a better place!

## Cashout

The best way to handle cashout is by using [monBee](https://github.com/ldeffenb/monBee), 
an excellent terminal frontend for monitoring your hive. The command to run 
has already been generated by the templates.

To monitor with monBee:

```bash
$ ./monBee.sh
```

To cashout with monBee:

```bash
$ ./monBee.sh --cashout
```

## Bringing down a hive

So the bees have been hard at work, but now it's time to dismantle the hive.
Simply run:

```bash
$ sudo ./down.sh
```

**NOTE**: This does NOT delete the hive directory hosting all the data.
